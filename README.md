Skyscrapers Puzzle
Objective:
The Skyscrapers puzzle is played on an NxN grid. The goal is to place skyscrapers of different heights in such a way that every row and column contains each height exactly once. Additionally, clues around the edges of the grid indicate how many skyscrapers are visible when looking into the grid from that direction.

Rules:
Grid and Skyscrapers:

The grid is NxN in size, where N is the number of skyscrapers.
Each cell in the grid contains a skyscraper with a height from 1 to N.
Each row and column must contain each height exactly once.
Visibility Clues:

Numbers on the edges of the grid (top, bottom, left, right) indicate how many skyscrapers are visible when looking along the row or column from that direction.
A skyscraper is visible if there are no taller skyscrapers in front of it blocking the view.
Example:
Consider a 4x4 grid with skyscrapers of heights 1 to 4.

 

The number 2 on the top row, first column, indicates that 2 skyscrapers will be visible from the top when looking down that column.
The number 3 on the leftmost column, first row, indicates that 3 skyscrapers will be visible from the left when looking across that row.
Objective:
Fill the grid with the heights of the skyscrapers, satisfying all rules and constraints.

This puzzle challenges logical reasoning and deduction skills, akin to Sudoku but with an added complexity due to the visibility clues.
